/**
 * MapJournal — owns the change-tracking and wire-protocol identity for a MapSchema.
 *
 * Replaces three parallel structures that previously lived on MapSchema:
 *   - `$indexes: Map<number, K>`        →  `keyByIndex`
 *   - `_collectionIndexes: { [key]: number }` (+ counter)  →  `indexByKey` + `nextIndex`
 *   - `deletedItems: { [index]: V }`    →  `snapshots`
 *
 * The journal is the single source of truth for:
 *   - assigning wire-protocol indexes to keys (server side)
 *   - looking up keys from wire indexes (server + client)
 *   - holding snapshots of removed values (for view-filter visibility checks)
 *
 * The journal does NOT track per-index operation types or maintain enqueue
 * order — those remain on `ChangeTree` for now. A future iteration may pull
 * them in too, but this version is intentionally scoped to the data-model
 * cleanup so we can validate the abstraction before going deeper.
